        <h3><font color="474e5d">PERSONAL DATA STORY </font></h3>

        <p><font color="474e5d">
          Our first project for this course required us to examine our digital habits and record our findings. In my data collection project, I tracked my online interactions with inspiration. Whenever I found something to be inspiring on my ios devices, whether it be a picture, an illustration or some form of art. I recorded the time, the app, the piece of art itself, and then rated the impact on a scale of 1 through 5. One being “ok” and 5 is mind-blowing.
        </font></p>

        <p><font color="474e5d">
          After collecting data for about a week and a half I put all of my information in a spreadsheet to better analyze the results I found. I noticed a trend in the app usage, and inspiration rating to be most eye-catching. Then the next step was to create a visualization that would represent my collected data. With different charts in mind such as temporal and special, I began to construct my visualization.

        <p><font color="474e5d">
          I decided to hand draw my inspiration as sprouts. Growing as each piece of inspiration hit. After hand drawing each piece of inspiration I scanned the images into my computer and vectorized them. It was important to me to hand draw whatever objects I was using. I just enjoy the process. After some feedback and revisions, I decided to organize each “node” into apps. This allows you to see the app usage as well as which where I found the most inspiring and many other pieces of information.
        </font></p>

        <p><font color="474e5d">
          I found this project to be very personal as the rating system was purely based on my personal emotions and opinions. And the results some interesting ways I interact with art.

          <p><font color="white">
          Our second project for this required us to examine psychographics and their ethical implementations of how they are used as well as the consequences. This project we did a lot of research on the impacts of psychographics and their definition. We had the opportunity to story board our ideas and create an outline for what we described in the video.
          </font></p>

          <p><font color="white">
            As this was a group effort my part consisted of editing the video together as well as my own section. I created short animation and stitched all the information we found together using Adobe After Effects. Or main discussion in the video was defining psychographics, explain how they were used, and then discussing the ethical issues behind using them.

          For our final project, we were tasked with building this website! We reviewed HTML and CSS in the programs atom & Git Hub. We learned a bit about HTML grid systems and ways of laying out and organize web pages. There was a lot of attention to learning hierarchy of HTML code (you can see it for yourself if you “inspect” the webpage). During our introduction to HTML, we also learned several C.R.A.P principles; contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity. With those ideas in mind. I broke my webpage down into sections or “div” groups. Then decided on font variants in the Monsterrat family for contrast and readability. This website incorporates all of the knowledge I've gained this semester on top of what I already brought into the class. So please enjoy my first website. </font></p>
